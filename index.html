        <h2>About Me</h2>

    

        
        <p>Hello! I'm Thomas Lee, a senior at Boston University pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. I have a passion for developing technology solutions that combine creativity, logic, and problem-solving. My academic focus has been on graphics programming, 3D modeling, and interactive systems, and I’m always eager to learn more.</p>

        <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
        <p>In my free time, I love exploring new technologies, reading books on software design and algorithms, and honing my programming skills. I’m also an avid gamer and enjoy playing <strong>League of Legends</strong>, which has inspired some of my projects.</p>

        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>After graduation, I plan to pursue a <strong>Master’s degree in Computer Graphics</strong> to deepen my knowledge in areas such as 3D rendering, computer animation, and interactive design. I’m excited to keep exploring new fields, contribute to innovative projects, and collaborate with others in the tech and gaming industries.</p>
