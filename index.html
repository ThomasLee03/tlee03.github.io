        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Thomas Lee, a senior at Boston University pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. I have a passion for developing technology solutions that combine creativity, logic, and problem-solving. My academic focus has been on systems programming, distributed computing, and data science, and I’m always eager to learn more.</p>

        <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
        <p>In my free time, I love exploring new technologies, reading books on software design and algorithms, and honing my programming skills. I’m also an avid gamer and enjoy playing <strong>League of Legends</strong>, which has inspired some of my projects.</p>

        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>After graduation, I plan to pursue a <strong>Master’s degree in Computer Systems</strong> to deepen my knowledge and eventually work on large-scale distributed systems or artificial intelligence. I’m excited to keep exploring new fields, contribute to meaningful projects, and collaborate with others in the tech industry.</p>
