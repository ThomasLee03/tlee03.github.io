                <li><strong>Product 1:</strong> Created a non-modal dialog that exported, cropped, renamed, and added matte layers from Storyboard Pro. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilized <strong>GraphicsMagick</strong> to perform cropping operations and revert crops as needed.</li>

                        <li>Cropped and exported a specific layer from Storyboard Pro.</li>
                        <li>Integrated the exported layer into a <strong>ComfyUI workflow</strong> to generate an AI-based image.</li>
                        <li>The AI workflow utilized a <strong>LoRA model</strong>, trained on previous images of a specific character, to generate new images based on the exported pose.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Collaborated with a team to refine processes and ensure smooth workflow integration.</li>
